# GloballyConsistentRules
Implementation of algorithms from the paper _Globally-Consistent Rule-Based Summary-Explanations for Machine Learning Models: Application to Credit-Risk Evaluation_ by Cynthia Rudin and Yaron Shaposhnik  

SSRN link: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3395422

Files: 
* Tutorial.ipynb - a short tutorial
* ConsistentLocalRules.py - PuLP implementation (can easily be modified to work with other solvers)
* ConsistentLocalRules(Gurobi).py - Gurobi implementation (specialized for Gurobi, but an order of magnitude faster)
